# Musical Genres Classification


This project is used to classify music genres. The neural network model is constructed by python3.7+keras+tensorflow, which is divided into DNN and LSTM. The open source database used is GTZAN.
<br>All projects codes and required related documents are stored in the folder musical_genres_classification. 

## FeatureExtraction_MFCC.ipynb 
The program is used to extract music features, the csv file generated is stored in the holder and can be applied directly.

<br>os
<br>csv
<br>librosa
<br>pandas
<br>numpy
<br>matplotlib
<br>warnings
